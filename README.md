# nvim-drive
nvim-drive is a simple Neovim plugin that allows you to connect Google Drive
(and potentially other cloud services in the future) to Neovim. Originally
developed as a graduation project, it has been adapted for personal use and is
still under development *and a little buggy*

This is a public source repository, and it will be maintained as long as I
continue using it.

> [!NOTE]
> This project has been moved from GitLab, and the entire Git history has been deleted for security reasons.
